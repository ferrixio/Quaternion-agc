# How to assemble a quaternion

üêâ Author: Samuele Ferri (@ferrixio)

## Basic construction

A quaternion can be defined in the _standard_ way using integers, floats, lists or tuples. The main constructor has six (optional) arguments:

+ **real**: a float, pre-initialized to 0, representing the real part;
+ **i_img**: a float, pre-initialized to 0, representing the first imaginary part;
+ **j_img**: a float, pre-initialized to 0, representing the second imaginary part;
+ **k_img**: a float, pre-initialized to 0, representing the third imaginary part;
+ **seq**: a list or tuple, pre-initialized to None, representing the components of the quaternion;
+ **acc**: a float, pre-initialized to 1e-13, representing the accuracy of the quaternion.

The "pre-constructor" `__new__` checks if the arguments in input are valid, else an error will raise.

After the object is constructed, it will only have two attributes in the `self` variable:

- `q`: a 4-list of the four components of the quaternion;
- `ACCURACY`: the limit of the floating point.

To get its principal elements, seven properties were added:

+ **real**, to get the real part
+ **i**, to get the first imaginary part;
+ **j**, to get the second imaginary part;
+ **k**, to get the third imaginary part;
+ **norm**, to get the euclidean norm of the quaternion as 4D-vector;
+ **vector**, to get a three dimensional array containing the three imaginary parts;
+ **rotation**, to get the rotation associated to the quaternion.

### :pencil2: From a complex number

It is possible to build a quaternion from a complex number, using the classmethod `from_complex`. It takes in input a complex number and an optional string representing which quaternionic-imaginary part the complex-j represents.

### :pencil2: From a rotation

Any 3D rotation (theta, x1, x2, x3) is indeed a unitary quaternion (a, b, c, d). Its components are:

```py
a = cos(theta/2)
b = x1*sin(theta/2)
c = x2*sin(theta/2)
d = x3*sin(theta/2)
```

In the opposite direction, inverting the previous equations, the method fails when the real part of the quaternion is 1. In these cases, the rotation is set to (0,(1,0,0)).

### :pencil2: Using random_unit()

With this method, three numbers between 0 and 1 are randomly generated. Then, the quaternion is setted to be unitary.
To avoid floating point inaccuracy, the procedure repeats the generation until it gets an unitary quaternion. 

### :pencil2: Using random(a,b)

Similar to the previous one, this method generates a quaternion whose components are random float extracted with the uniform distribution in [a,b]. Default values of `a` and `b` are -50 and 50.
